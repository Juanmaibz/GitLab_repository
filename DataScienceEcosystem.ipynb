    "    * **Apache Hadoop** manages data processing and storage for big data applications running on clustered systems.\n",
    "    * **Apache MLLib**, which makes machine learning scalable.\n",
    "    * **Java-ML**, which is a machine learning library.\n",
    "* *R-Studio*: It is most often used by statisticians, mathematicians, and data miners to develop statistical software, graphs, and data analysis.\n",
    "    * It is further into the value set.\n",
    "    * Both open source software and free software commonly refer to the same set of licenses.\n",
    "    * R has become the world's largest repository of statistical knowledge.\n",
    "* *SQL*: It is not considered like the other languages because it is a non-procedural language and its scope is limited to querying and managing data. \n",
    "    * This language is useful in handling structured data, that is, data that incorporates relationships between entities and variables.\n",
    "    * SQL was designed to manage data in relational databases.\n",
    "    * First appeared in 1974. And SQL was developed at IBM.\n",
    "* *SCALA*: It is a general purpose programming language that provides support for functional programming and a strong static type system.\n",
    "    * Spark is a fast, general-purpose cluster computing system.\n",
    "    * **MLLib**, for machine learning.\n",
    "    * **GraphX**, for graphics processing.\n",
    "* *C++*: It is the general purpose programming language. It improves processing speed, enables system programming, and provides broader control over application or software.\n",
    "    * A popular deep learning library for data flow called *TensorFlow* was built using C++.\n",
    "    * **MongoDB**, a NoSQL database for managing big data, was built using C++.\n",
    "    * **Caffe** is a repository of deep learning algorithms built with C++, with Python and MATLAB bindings."
